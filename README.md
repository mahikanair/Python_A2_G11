Comparison of time complexities b/w sorting- Bubble and Merge sort, and, searching- Linear and Binary search algorithms.

Bubble Sort: simplest sorting algo that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are not in the required order. Time Complexity: O(N^2) Space Complexity: O(1)

Merge Sort: is a divide and conquer algo, works by dividing the input array iin two halves, and calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. Time Complexity: O(N*log(N)) Space Complexity: O(N)

Linear Search: a sequential manner is used to find the required element. Every element is checked about the value we're searching. If both are equal, then the element is found and the process returns that element's index position. Time Complexity: O(N) Space Complexity: for iterative:- O(1); for recursive:- O(N)

Binary Search: used to search an element in a sorted array. It's an efficient algorithm and is better than linear search in terms of time complexity. Time Complexity: O(log N) Space Complexity: O(log N)

It's expected that Merge Sort is the better one when compared to Bubble Sort in normal and worst case scenarios. It's also expected that Binary Search is going to be better than Linear Search(when using sorted data) in normal and worst case scenarios, as when there is unsorted data Binary Search cannot be applied.
